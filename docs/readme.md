# Ninja Way 2

## Introduction

Welcome to our platformer game!

As students of the second grade in game design in CITM Terrassa, we have made a platformer game for the subject of game development.
Here, you will be a ninja whose goal is to get to the end of the levels passing throught a sort of handicaps and enemies. This can be reach using 2 different skills: shooting a kunai and teleporting yourself.

## Core subsystems and innovations

First of all we started to make our platformer game by drawing a map with Tiled with its layers and properties and a mechanic like teleport to make the game more interesting. Then we added enemies using A* and the way to kill them (in this case is by shooting a kunai). And finally, we added UI as well as a main menu where the player can choose between two characters, settings were the language and music volume can be changed, and credits. In addition, in the scene we added hearts to represent player's lifes, a book to know if it is caught or not, puntuation and a timer.

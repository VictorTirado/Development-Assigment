# Ninja Way 2

## Introduction

Welcome to our platformer game!

As students of the second grade in game design in CITM Terrassa, we have made a platformer game for the subject of game development.
Here, you will be a ninja whose goal is to get to the end of the levels passing throught a sort of handicaps and enemies. This can be reach using 2 different skills: shooting a kunai and teleporting yourself.
